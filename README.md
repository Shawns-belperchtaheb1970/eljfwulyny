Just got out of seeing G20 and, honestly, what a whirlwind. I mean, how do you even start unpacking that? The film kicks off with more intensity than a toddler on a sugar rush—Man, boom! You're on a chaotic rollercoaster with no seatbelts. Politicians doing their thing while the world paints them with layers of drama and, well, some questionable decisions. 

> First off, can we talk about the sheer absurdity of global leaders stuck in one place together? It’s like watching cats in a box, just with way more egos and expensive suits. Half the time I wondered if they were gonna sort out world peace or swipe right on each other. Somehow both seemed equally plausible, ya know? There's Elton... no, Madison! Got almost caught up there, already mixing things.

And oh boy, the soundtrack. Who decided that tension would be better if it was set to classical music, raining down like a goddamn heavy metal thunderstorm? Every escalating scene felt like a heart attack waiting to happen. Also, note to self: Don't watch this movie right after work. My brain feels like a spaghetti junction at rush hour, but with plot twists instead of cars.

In the midst of this crazy political circus, there's a moment, one fleeting moment, when you get it. When you're like, Ah, the leaders are just humans too, flawed in all their stressed-out glory. Then a few minutes later, you're back thinking, “Did they download the movie script from some drama-thriller-generating algorithm?”

Anyway, I kinda left the theater feeling like I’d run a marathon but only reached the start line. Hoping to rewatch some bits because the first watch is like sprinting through an art gallery with your eyes half-open.

```javascript
function solveConflict(decisionMakers) {
  return decisionMakers.reduce((acc, leader) => (acc.includes(leader) ? acc : [...acc, leader]), []);
}
```

Wasn't sure why the random code popped in my mind, maybe some subplot boiled down to computer logic? Lol. It's like my brain was trying to solve their issues with JavaScript.

By the end, I wasn’t sure if I was inspired, tired, or both. G20 is packed with more drama than a family reunion, and I can't decide if I love that or never want to see another political thriller again. But hey, maybe just watch the movie and figure it out yourself. Or download it and pause whenever your brain feels like it’s setting off its own suspense soundtrack. Probably that's what I'll do next time.
